# GOOGLE DRIVE API

## Instalation
run this command
```
npm install
node app.js
```
### Working with this
You need your own account details for uploading file into your account drive.
That's why you need to put all details into env file.

### I build this project for uploading my exported data from DB to the google drive.
😅

Feature implemented -> Upload

#### Note: When I run app.js into Digitalocean VM, It's not working for env file that's why I used all secrets into the app.js
